Companies Involved in Chiplet Manufacturing</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"indiancompaniesandinitiatives\"><strong>Indian Companies and Initiatives</strong></h3>\n<p>Several Indian companies have embarked on chiplet manufacturing or advanced semiconductor packaging initiatives. <strong>Tata Group</strong> is emerging as a key player: Tata Electronics, in partnership with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp (PSMC), is setting up India’s first semiconductor  fab in Dholera, Gujarat to produce 28 nm chips. Tata has also launched <strong>Tata Semiconductor Assembly and Test (TSAT)</strong> to build an Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (OSAT) unit in Assam with an investment of ₹27,000 crore (~$3.3 billion) . This facility will develop <strong>indigenous advanced packaging</strong> technologies (e.g. flip-chip and system-in-package) with a planned capacity of 48 million chips per day. Another Indian conglomerate, <strong>Larsen & Toubro (L&T)</strong>, formed L&amp;T Semiconductor (LTSCT) in 2023 focusing on semiconductor design and intellectual property, with an eye towards areas like chiplet-based packaging in the future.</p>\n<p>India’s first locally-owned chip packaging success came from <strong>Sahasra Semiconductors</strong>, a Rajasthan-based firm. In October 2023, Sahasra became the <strong>first Indian company to produce memory chips</strong>, operating a semiconductor assembly, test, and packaging unit in Bhiwadi. Sahasra has begun shipping made-in-India microSD memory cards and plans to start <strong>advanced packaging of internal memory chips</strong> in its second phase. Government incentives under the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme and the Scheme for Promotion of Manufacturing of Electronic Components and Semiconductors (SPECS) have supported this venture, with SPECS providing a 25% capital expenditure subsidy for the plant. Other Indian players include legacy semiconductor assembly companies like <strong>SPEL Semiconductor</strong> (an OSAT in Chennai) and emerging firms such as <strong>Kaynes Technology</strong>, which received approval to set up an OSAT facility in Gujarat with a ₹3,307 crore investment (70% government-funded) and capacity of ~6.3 million chips per day. Fabless semiconductor design companies (e.g. <strong>MosChip</strong>, <strong>Signalchip</strong>) are also part of the ecosystem, working on chiplet-based system-on-chip designs, though their manufacturing is outsourced.</p>\n<h3 id=\"foreigninvestmentsandpartnerships\"><strong>Foreign Investments and Partnerships</strong></h3>\n<p>Global semiconductor companies are increasingly investing in India’s chiplet and semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, often via partnerships with Indian firms. <strong>Micron Technology (USA)</strong> is a notable entrant – in June 2023, the Union Cabinet approved Micron’s $2.75 billion proposal to set up a large Assembly, Testing, Marking, and Packaging (ATMP) facility in Sanand, Gujarat. Construction of this plant (India’s first of its kind) began in mid-2023 and is over 60% complete; once operational in 2025, it will package and test memory (DRAM/NAND) chips, largely for export. Micron is investing $825 million of the total, with the Indian central government covering 50% of the project cost and the state government a further 20% – a testament to the heavy incentives on offer.</p>\n<p>Taiwan’s <strong>Foxconn</strong> (Hon Hai Precision) has also committed to India’s semiconductor venture. In 2024, <strong>Foxconn and Indian conglomerate HCL</strong> announced a joint venture to establish an OSAT unit for chip packaging and testing, with Foxconn investing $37.2 million for a 40% stake. This comes after the Foxconn–Vedanta attempt to build a $19.5 billion fab in Gujarat, which was shelved in 2023 due to slow progress and the search for a technology partner. Foxconn remains <em>“committed to India”</em> and is now seeking new partners and applying under India’s incentive scheme to set up semiconductor manufacturing using mature nodes (e.g. 40 nm) for applications like automotive electronics. Another Taiwanese firm, <strong>PSMC</strong>, as noted, is partnering with Tata for the 28 nm fab – bringing in foundry expertise and marking a major foreign collaboration.</p>\n<p>Japan’s semiconductor industry is involved as well. <strong>Renesas Electronics (Japan)</strong> has teamed up with India’s <strong>CG Power</strong> and Thailand’s <strong>Sterling & Wilson (through Stars Microelectronics)</strong> to establish a semiconductor ATMP unit in Gujarat for specialized chips, with a ₹7,600 crore (≈$920 million) investment. Renesas will provide technology for manufacturing microcontrollers, analog and power semiconductors, targeting automotive, industrial and consumer applications. This partnership underscores a trend of foreign tech transfer: Renesas’ expertise in automotive chips will help India produce chips for cars and power electronics locally.</p>\n<p>Other global players are strengthening India’s semiconductor ecosystem primarily via R\\&amp;D and design centers, which complements chiplet development. For instance, <strong>Applied Materials</strong> (USA) is investing $400 million in an engineering center in Bengaluru, and <strong>AMD</strong> (USA) is investing $400 million to expand its India design center – now the company’s largest globally. While these investments are in chip design and research (not fabrication), they focus on areas like advanced chip architectures (AI, GPUs, etc.) that often use chiplet designs. <strong>IBM</strong> (USA) has signed agreements with the Indian government to become a knowledge partner for the <strong>India Semiconductor Mission</strong>; IBM is helping establish a semiconductor research center that will promote innovation in <strong>advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration</strong> (the core of chiplet technology). This collaboration aims to share IBM’s expertise in chip design and packaging, fostering local capability in 3D IC and chiplets. These partnerships, along with others in the pipeline (such as ongoing India–Japan and India–US dialogues), are accelerating technology transfer and joint ventures, positioning India as an emerging destination for semiconductor assembly and potentially chiplet manufacturing.</p>\n<div class=\"max-w-3xl mx-auto px-4 text-center border\">\n  <h2 class=\"text-3xl font-bold text-gray-800 mb-4\">\n    Ready to Transform Your Business?\n  </h2>\n\n  <p class=\"text-lg text-gray-600 mb-8\">\n    Join industry leaders who've already discovered how our solutions can drive growth.

Market and Industry Data</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"indianchipletmarketsizeandgrowth\"><strong>Indian Chiplet Market Size and Growth</strong></h3>\n<p>India’s chiplet market is currently at a nascent stage but is poised for rapid growth this decade. As of now, India represents a very small share of the global chiplet market (since domestic production of chiplet-based devices is minimal), but projections indicate an explosive rise as ecosystem investments bear fruit. Market studies project the <strong>India chiplet market to grow at ~77.8% CAGR from 2023 to 2030</strong> – one of the fastest growth rates worldwide. This growth will be driven by new domestic packaging and assembly capacity coming online (such as Micron’s and Tata’s plants) and increasing demand from Indian industries for high-performance chips. By comparison, the overall <strong>Asia-Pacific chiplet market</strong> (dominated by China, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan) is expected to grow at ~76% CAGR in the same period. China currently leads adoption in the region – it <strong>dominated the Asia-Pacific chiplet market in 2022</strong> and is on track to achieve a market value of about $48 billion by 2030, thanks to heavy investments in 5G, AI, and chip manufacturing. India’s absolute chiplet market size in 2030 is projected to remain smaller than China’s, but the high growth rate reflects India’s low base and the strong upside as new capacity and use-cases develop.</p>\n<p>In the broader semiconductor context, <strong>India’s semiconductor consumption market</strong> (which includes all chips, not just chiplets) is expected to reach $52 billion in 2024-25 and grow to ~$103 billion by 2030. This represents a ~13% CAGR in semiconductor demand, driven by industries like mobile devices, IT, automotive, and industrial electronics. A portion of this growing demand will shift toward chiplet-based components as they become more common in advanced products. Currently, most high-end chips (including chiplet-based processors) are imported; however, as local packaging plants become operational (e.g. Micron’s 2025 timeline) and if planned fabs come online by late decade, India could start supplying a share of its own demand.</p>\n<h3 id=\"globalchipletmarketcomparison\"><strong>Global Chiplet Market Comparison</strong></h3>\n<p>Globally, the chiplet market is expanding exponentially as the semiconductor industry embraces modular architectures. In 2023, the <strong>global chiplet market</strong> was valued around <strong>$6.5 billion</strong>, but it is forecast to reach <strong>$148 billion by 2028</strong> – an astonishing ~86.7% CAGR in five years. Some long-term forecasts are even more bullish; for instance, one analysis projects the market to surge to <strong>$1.72 trillion by 2032</strong> (over 70% CAGR) as chiplet-based designs become ubiquitous in high-performance computing and AI hardware. While estimates vary, all agree on strong double- or triple-digit growth driven by industry-wide adoption of chiplets to overcome the limits of Moore’s Law.</p>\n<p>In this global landscape, <strong>Asia-Pacific is currently the leading region</strong> for chiplet technology by revenue, accounting for roughly 40% of the market (as of 2024). This is unsurprising given that major chip manufacturers and packagers in Taiwan, South Korea, and China are at the forefront of advanced packaging. The <strong>United States</strong> and <strong>Taiwan</strong> are key players in chiplet innovation: U.S. companies like AMD and Intel pioneered chiplet-based CPUs (e.g. EPYC and Ryzen series), and U.S. government initiatives (CHIPS Act) are channeling funds into chiplet-related manufacturing and R\\&amp;D. Taiwan’s TSMC and ASE Group lead in 2.5D/3D packaging technologies that enable chiplet integration. <strong>China</strong> is rapidly ramping up chiplet capabilities as well – for example, Chinese firms are using chiplets in 5G network equipment, edge computing devices, and even smart city infrastructure, and China is reportedly <em>“ramping up purchases of chip packaging equipment”</em> to bolster large-scale chiplet manufacturing. In comparison, <strong>India’s chiplet segment</strong> is still in an infancy stage; India contributed only around 1% of global semiconductor trade in recent years and an even smaller fraction in advanced packaging. However, India’s government and industry are aiming to leverage the global shift to chiplets as a <strong>jump-start opportunity</strong>, much like India leapfrogged in mobile telecom. By focusing on assembly, packaging and design (rather than immediately on cutting-edge fabs), India seeks to integrate into this burgeoning chiplet supply chain.</p>\n<h3 id=\"indiascompetitiveadvantages\"><strong>India’s Competitive Advantages</strong></h3>\n<p>India’s push into chiplet manufacturing builds on several competitive advantages. First is the <strong>extensive semiconductor design talent pool</strong>: roughly <em>20% of the world’s chip designers</em> are based in India, working for firms like Intel, Qualcomm, AMD, and many startups. This large skilled workforce in chip <em>design</em> can be harnessed to develop chiplet architectures and IP blocks locally. The presence of established design R\\&amp;D centers (as noted with AMD, Google Tensor team, etc. in India) means India understands the design requirements for chiplet-based systems, which is a critical piece of the value chain.</p>\n<p>Secondly, India offers a <strong>cost advantage and government support</strong>. The government’s incentive schemes (discussed in the next section) significantly reduce capital costs for setting up packaging and fab units – e.g. 50% capital subsidy for fabs and 30%+ for ATMP facilities. Combined with relatively lower labor costs, this can make India an attractive location for labor-intensive chip assembly and testing activities. The geopolitical climate also favors India as an alternative manufacturing hub (a “China+1” strategy). India’s large domestic electronics market (projected to be one of the largest consumers of semiconductors) provides assurance of local demand for any chiplet-based components made in India. Additionally, India has strengths in software and systems integration – important for co-designing chiplet systems and the software that runs on them, especially in domains like AI and telecommunications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"challengesfacingindiaschipletindustry\"><strong>Challenges Facing India’s Chiplet Industry</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite optimism, India faces significant <strong>challenges</strong> in establishing a robust chiplet manufacturing industry. A major hurdle is the <strong>lack of existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure</strong> – India does not yet have an operational advanced node semiconductor fab, and its legacy fab (SCL Chandigarh) is on older technology. Building new fabs and advanced packaging facilities from scratch is capital-intensive and time-consuming, requiring coordination among numerous stakeholders. The lead times for facilities like the Tata-PSMC fab mean India’s own chiplet-enabled silicon (at 28 nm) won’t roll out until at least 2025-2027. In the interim, India must rely on foreign-made wafers/dies and focus on packaging those – which limits the value capture.</p>\n<p>Another challenge is the <strong>shortage of specialized semiconductor manufacturing talent and supporting supply chain</strong>. India has abundant chip design engineers, but a dearth of experienced fab engineers, technicians, and assembly experts. As one industry analysis noted, India is <em>“currently facing [an] alarming shortage of skilled workforce”</em> in semiconductor manufacturing, along with infrastructure gaps. Training or importing talent is necessary to run fabs and ATMPs at yield. Moreover, key raw materials and equipment for chiplet integration (photolithography tools, advanced substrates, etc.) are not produced in India and will have to be imported, raising costs and logistical complexity.</p>\n<p><strong>Competition from established semiconductor hubs</strong> is also stiff. Countries like <strong>Taiwan, South Korea, and the US</strong> have years of head-start in chiplet and 3D packaging technologies, backed by strong industrial ecosystems. For India to win investments, it must offer not just subsidies but also consistent policies, reliable power and water supply, and IP protection. Past attempts (such as the stalled Vedanta-Foxconn fab and other proposals) show that securing a technology partner is crucial – India needs to convince top-tier firms (like TSMC, Intel, or STMicro) to transfer know-how, which can be challenging. Finally, the <strong>high capital cost</strong> of chiplet-capable fabs and packaging lines could be a bottleneck if not met with sustained funding; a single advanced packaging line can cost billions, and maintaining cutting-edge capability (for example, adopting the latest interposer or hybrid bonding techniques) will require continuous investment. Despite these challenges, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic: with strong government push and global companies looking to diversify manufacturing, India has a window of opportunity to carve out a niche in chiplet assembly and integration.</p>\n<h2 id=\"3specificapplicationsanddemandtrendsforchipletsinindia\"><strong>3. Specific Applications and Demand Trends for Chiplets in India</strong></h2>\n<p>Chiplets are a modular approach to building complex chips, and their use cases span many high-tech industries. Globally, <strong>high-performance computing (HPC)</strong> and <strong>artificial intelligence</strong> are primary drivers for chiplet adoption, and this trend is mirrored in India’s tech ecosystem. As India builds out data centers and supercomputing capabilities, there is rising demand for server CPUs and AI accelerators that use chiplet architectures. For example, modern <strong>server processors</strong> like AMD EPYC or Intel Xeon chips (widely used in cloud data centers) integrate multiple chiplets to boost core counts and performance. Indian data center operators and cloud providers (including global players setting up regions in India) are deploying such chiplet-based CPUs to support cloud services and AI workloads. The <strong>proliferation of data centers worldwide</strong> – India included – is cited as a key driver for the chiplet industry’s growth. In AI, the need for specialized hardware is acute; chiplets allow mixing of processing cores and AI accelerators. This means AI startups and research labs in India can benefit from chips that combine, say, a CPU chiplet with a custom AI coprocessor chiplet. As generative AI and machine learning adoption grows in India (e.g. in cloud AI platforms or edge AI for smart industries), demand will increase for these high-performance multi-die chips.</p>\n<p>Another domain seeing chiplet use is <strong>consumer electronics and mobile devices</strong>, which is highly relevant given India’s huge smartphone market. Chiplet designs can improve power efficiency and customize features in devices. Already, <strong>smartphones and tablets</strong> are starting to leverage multi-chip packages – for instance, to integrate modem, processor, and AI engine dies. This modular design helps manage heat and yields. Industry reports indicate that the <strong>consumer electronics sector is set to dominate the global chiplet market</strong> in coming years, fueled by demand for high-performance yet energy-efficient phones, tablets, and laptops. In India, where over 150 million smartphones are sold annually, manufacturers could eventually adopt chiplets to differentiate their products (for now, most phone SoCs are monolithic, but chiplet approaches may appear in future 5G or AI-intensive phones). Additionally, the rise of <strong>wearables and smart home devices</strong> in India contributes to IoT growth – chiplets can be used to pack more functionality into these small form-factor gadgets. For instance, a wearable might use a chiplet-based SiP (System-in-Package) to include sensor hubs, processors, and connectivity in one compact module.</p>\n<p>The <strong>automotive sector</strong> in India is an emerging area where chiplets could play a role. Cars are increasingly “computers on wheels,” requiring chips for engine control, infotainment, ADAS (advanced driver assistance), and electric vehicle battery management. <strong>Modern vehicles require efficient processors for autonomous driving and real-time analytics</strong>, and chiplets provide a flexible way to achieve the needed performance and integration. In India, the push for electric vehicles (EVs) and connected cars means new demand for automotive semiconductors. Chiplet-based designs allow mixing high-performance processors with safety-critical microcontrollers or analog components. Notably, the Renesas-CG facility being set up in Gujarat plans to <strong>manufacture chips for automotive and power applications</strong> using chiplet-like multi-die packaging (to integrate power management, microcontroller, and connectivity functions). As Indian automotive companies (and global OEMs in India) advance toward ADAS and eventually autonomous features, they will likely utilize chiplet-based controllers and sensors, supplied either by local packaging units or imported.</p>\n<p>Beyond these, a range of <strong>industrial and networking applications</strong> in India stand to benefit from chiplets. The <strong>telecommunications sector</strong>, for example, with 5G rollout, needs high-performance networking gear. Base stations and network switches can use chiplets to combine processors, accelerators, and I/O dies for better throughput. The rise of 5G and edge computing in India is creating opportunities for customized chiplet solutions – as seen globally, <em>“the rise in demand for AI, 5G, and IoT applications fuels chiplet adoption.”</em> In industrial automation, factories implementing Industry 4.0 will use edge devices and PLCs that could adopt chiplet-based multicore processors to handle complex tasks. <strong>Healthcare devices</strong> and <strong>military/aerospace</strong> in India (sectors where reliability is key) could also use chiplets; for instance, a defense-grade system-on-module might integrate radar processing and secure elements as separate chiplets in one package.</p>\n<p>In summary, the key industries for chiplets in India align with global trends:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Data centers and Cloud AI</strong> – driving need for chiplet-based CPUs and AI accelerators to support cloud services and AI training/inference.</li>\n<li><strong>Consumer electronics (Smartphones, PCs, gaming)</strong> – looking to chiplets for performance gains and power efficiency in devices; reports highlight that integrating chiplets enables <em>“innovation, compact designs, and efficiency”</em> in consumer devices.</li>\n<li><strong>Automotive and Industrial (incl. IoT)</strong> – requiring heterogeneous integration (mixing logic, analog, power chiplets) for EVs, smart vehicles, IoT sensors, and automation controllers.</li>\n<li><strong>Telecom and Networking</strong> – 5G infrastructure and upcoming 6G or networking hardware can use chiplets to meet high bandwidth and low latency requirements.</li>\n<li><strong>Defense and Aerospace</strong> – strategic applications where on-shore packaging of critical chips (with chiplet tech) could be important for security and customization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>India is at the early stage of utilizing chiplets in these sectors. Much of the current demand is met by imports (e.g. importing an AMD chiplet-based processor for a server, or an AI GPU for a research lab). However, as domestic capability in chiplet packaging improves, we can expect more <strong>“Made in India”</strong> multi-chip modules catering to local industries, especially in automotive and electronics. The government’s emphasis on emerging areas like <strong>AI and IoT</strong> means that demand for chiplet-based solutions in those areas is set to increase swiftly, ensuring a growing market for any local chiplet manufacturing ventures.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4governmentpoliciesandincentives\"><strong>4. Government Policies and Incentives</strong></h2>\n<h3 id=\"policyinitiativesindiasemiconductormissionandplischeme\"><strong>Policy Initiatives: India Semiconductor Mission and PLI Scheme</strong></h3>\n<p>The Indian government has launched several policy initiatives to support semiconductor and chiplet manufacturing, recognizing it as a strategic industry. In late 2021, the government set up the <strong>India Semiconductor Mission (ISM)</strong> as a dedicated agency to drive India’s semiconductor program. Under this mission, a <strong>$10 billion incentive package</strong> (PLI – Production Linked Incentive scheme for semiconductors and displays) was approved to attract chip fabrication units and ATMP/OSAT facilities. This includes generous capital subsidies: up to <strong>50% of project cost for eligible semiconductor fabs and display fabs</strong>, and around <strong>30% of capital expenditure for ATMP/OSAT (chip assembly and packaging) units</strong>. For example, the ISM’s modified program offers to cover half the cost of establishing fabs at mature nodes, which was a key factor in recent proposals (Tata-PSMC fab, Vedanta-Foxconn earlier). States complement this with their own incentives (such as subsidized land, electricity, and additional capital grants like Gujarat’s 20% for the Micron plant).</p>\n<p>Alongside fabrication, the government introduced a <strong>Design-Linked Incentive (DLI)</strong> scheme to encourage domestic semiconductor design (including startups working on chiplet IP). This scheme provides financial support (such as reimbursements for design house expenses and product development) to make India a hub for chip design. The idea is to create a pipeline of Indian-designed chiplets and chips that could eventually be manufactured or packaged in India.</p>\n<p>By mid-2023, seeing the intense global competition, the government indicated that it would <strong>expand and extend these incentives</strong>. In September 2024, ISM’s CEO announced a <strong>“fresh incentives package”</strong> was in the works, likely exceeding another $10 billion, to support the industry for the next 10 years. This new package is set to broaden support to the entire ecosystem, including semiconductor <strong>components and materials</strong>, not just fabs, reflecting a more holistic approach. The goal is to have at least 5 more fabs and multiple packaging units by the end of the decade, which will require sustained incentive outlays. In essence, India’s policy framework (PLI and related schemes) heavily subsidizes capital investment, shares risk with investors, and provides infrastructure support to anyone setting up semiconductor manufacturing or advanced packaging in India. These policies specifically mention <strong>“advanced packaging”</strong> and <strong>“chiplets”</strong> as focus areas, underscoring that India aims to leap into the chiplet era rather than only chasing cutting-edge fab nodes.</p>\n<h3 id=\"governmentincentivesandinvestments\"><strong>Government Incentives and Investments</strong></h3>\n<p>The government incentives have translated into concrete support for chiplet-related manufacturing projects. As noted, Micron’s ATMP project is funded roughly 70% by central and state funds combined. Similarly, the approved units under ISM are all receiving significant subsidies: e.g., the Tata-PSMC fab (₹91,000 crore investment) will get 50% of capital from the government, and the Tata TSAT packaging plant (₹27,000 crore) will get around 50-70% government funding as well. The ISM’s strategy has been to share the upfront cost burden, making India a financially attractive location. In addition to cost-sharing, other incentives include <strong>tax breaks</strong> (semiconductor manufacturing is eligible for lower corporate tax rates of 17% in India, and often enjoys tax holidays), as well as infrastructure facilitation like setting up <strong>electronics manufacturing clusters</strong> with ready facilities. For instance, the Dholera Special Investment Region in Gujarat, where the Tata fab will be, is being developed with state support for power and water specifically for the fab’s needs.</p>\n<p>The government is also directly investing in skilling and research which indirectly incentivizes the industry. It has announced the <strong>SemiconIndia program</strong>, which includes funding for training 85,000 semiconductor professionals in the country and partnerships with institutes to launch semiconductor education curricula. Such workforce development is effectively an incentive for companies, as it ensures a pipeline of talent. Additionally, India’s public R\\&amp;D institutions (like C-DAC and IITs) have been allocated funds to work on areas like <strong>chiplet integration, 3D IC design, and compound semiconductors</strong>. The aim is to foster innovation that companies in India can utilize. For example, C-DAC is working on indigenous processor IP (the <strong>DIR-V RISC-V initiative</strong>) and exploring collaborations with IBM to possibly adopt or co-develop high-performance processors for India, which might involve chiplet designs for HPC.</p>\n<p>It’s worth noting that state governments are aggressively competing to host these projects by sweetening deals. Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana have all rolled out special policies for semiconductor and electronics. This includes reimbursement of GST, stamp duty waivers for land, subsidized loans, etc., on top of central incentives. The <strong>cumulative incentives</strong> can often cover 70-75% of a project’s cost, as seen in Micron’s case. Such generous support underscores how strategically important chip manufacturing is viewed in India’s policy circles.</p>\n<h3 id=\"internationalcollaborationsandtechnologytransfer\"><strong>International Collaborations and Technology Transfer</strong></h3>\n<p>India is actively engaging with foreign governments and companies to facilitate technology transfer and collaboration in semiconductors, which is crucial for catching up in chiplet and advanced packaging know-how. A landmark development is the <strong>India–USA semiconductor partnership</strong> forged in 2023. Under the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, a portion of funding (the <strong>International Technology Security and Innovation Fund</strong>) has been earmarked to help allies build up semiconductor capacity. The US government has decided to partner with India’s ISM using this fund – about <strong>$100 million per year until 2027</strong> – specifically to <strong>boost India’s assembly, testing, and packaging capabilities</strong>. This collaboration will start with the U.S. helping assess India’s ecosystem and identifying gaps, and is expected to lead to joint initiatives in workforce training, standards development, and possibly co-investment in facilities. The motive on the U.S. side is to diversify supply chains away from China, and on the Indian side to leapfrog into advanced packaging leadership. This partnership has already resulted in Indian delegations visiting U.S. packaging labs and an agreement to set up a training program for Indian engineers in American semiconductor fabs and ATMP plants.</p>\n<p>India has also deepened ties with <strong>Japan</strong> in this field. In July 2023, India and Japan signed a <strong>Memorandum of Cooperation on semiconductor supply chain partnership</strong>. Japan, which has expertise in materials, equipment, and mature node chips, is working with India to potentially set up facilities (for example, there were reports that a Japanese consortium may assist in a 65 nm analog fab in India). Japanese companies like <strong>Tokyo Electron</strong> (a major equipment maker) have partnered with Tata to supply tools for the upcoming fab, and others are exploring joint ventures in packaging. The India-Japan collaboration extends to research – the two governments are funding joint research projects on <strong>advanced packaging and chiplet integration</strong>, and have initiated talent exchange programs (Indian engineers training in Japan’s tech institutes). Similarly, <strong>European</strong> and <strong>Taiwanese</strong> collaborations are in progress. The <strong>EU “Chips Act”</strong> has a provision for international cooperation, and companies like <strong>STMicroelectronics (Europe)</strong> and <strong>TSMC (Taiwan)</strong> have been in discussions to either invest in India or help through technical consultancy. In fact, as part of its post-Foxconn strategy, India encouraged <strong>STMicro</strong> to be a tech partner in an Indian fab; while ST did not take equity, it was willing to license technology to Vedanta-Foxconn, and may yet partner with Foxconn or Vedanta separately. Additionally, Belgium’s research hub <strong>imec</strong> and France’s CEA-Leti have signed MoUs with Indian institutions to advise on setting up a semiconductor research center that includes 3D packaging test lines.</p>\n<p>Another notable collaboration is with <strong>Israel</strong>: the stalled ISMC analog fab project in Karnataka involved Tower Semiconductor (Israel) as a partner. With Intel’s takeover of Tower failing, that project may revive with direct Intel involvement or other Israeli expertise. Israel and India have also discussed working together on <strong>heterogeneous integration for defense electronics</strong> (where chiplets could be vital).</p>\n<p>Finally, the Indian government’s outreach to global industry is evident in events like the <strong>SemiconIndia conference</strong>, where CEOs of Intel, AMD, ARM, and others participated and pledged support. The government often highlights that companies setting up in India will not just serve the local market but also export, leveraging India’s strategic location and trade partnerships. In summary, international collaboration – whether via direct investment (Micron, Foxconn, Renesas), government-to-government agreements (US, Japan), or research partnerships (IBM, imec) – is a cornerstone of India’s strategy. It accelerates technology transfer in chiplet manufacturing techniques and assures global companies that India is committed to building a secure, thriving semiconductor ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Overall, India’s entry into chiplet manufacturing is being carefully scaffolded by supportive policies, significant financial incentives, and global partnerships. While the industry is still in early days, the coming together of Indian enterprise and multinational expertise under the government’s enabling framework has set the stage for India to become a notable player in chiplet-based semiconductor production in the years ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a

    "searchMaterial": "chiplet manufacturing in india: current state and outlook how tata, micron, and government incentives are powering india’s chiplet revolution by 2030 \n      1. companies involved in chiplet manufacturing indian companies and initiatives several indian companies have embarked on chiplet manufacturing or advanced semiconductor packaging initiatives. tata group is emerging as a key player: tata electronics, in partnership with taiwan’s powerchip semiconductor manufacturing corp (psmc), is setting up india’s first semiconductor fab in dholera, gujarat to produce 28 nm chips. tata has also launched tata semiconductor assembly and test (tsat) to build an outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (osat) unit in assam with an investment of ₹27,000 crore (~$3.3 billion) . this facility will develop indigenous advanced packaging technologies (e.g. flip-chip and system-in-package) with a planned capacity of 48 million chips per day. another indian conglomerate, larsen & toubro (l&t), formed l&amp;t semiconductor (ltsct) in 2023 focusing on semiconductor design and intellectual property, with an eye towards areas like chiplet-based packaging in the future. india’s first locally-owned chip packaging success came from sahasra semiconductors, a rajasthan-based firm. in october 2023, sahasra became the first indian company to produce memory chips, operating a semiconductor assembly, test, and packaging unit in bhiwadi. sahasra has begun shipping made-in-india microsd memory cards and plans to start advanced packaging of internal memory chips in its second phase. government incentives under the production-linked incentive (pli) scheme and the scheme for promotion of manufacturing of electronic components and semiconductors (specs) have supported this venture, with specs providing a 25% capital expenditure subsidy for the plant. other indian players include legacy semiconductor assembly companies like spel semiconductor (an osat in chennai) and emerging firms such as kaynes technology, which received approval to set up an osat facility in gujarat with a ₹3,307 crore investment (70% government-funded) and capacity of ~6.3 million chips per day. fabless semiconductor design companies (e.g. moschip, signalchip) are also part of the ecosystem, working on chiplet-based system-on-chip designs, though their manufacturing is outsourced. foreign investments and partnerships global semiconductor companies are increasingly investing in india’s chiplet and semiconductor manufacturing ecosystem, often via partnerships with indian firms. micron technology (usa) is a notable entrant – in june 2023, the union cabinet approved micron’s $2.75 billion proposal to set up a large assembly, testing, marking, and packaging (atmp) facility in sanand, gujarat. construction of this plant (india’s first of its kind) began in mid-2023 and is over 60% complete; once operational in 2025, it will package and test memory (dram/nand) chips, largely for export. micron is investing $825 million of the total, with the indian central government covering 50% of the project cost and the state government a further 20% – a testament to the heavy incentives on offer. taiwan’s foxconn (hon hai precision) has also committed to india’s semiconductor venture. in 2024, foxconn and indian conglomerate hcl announced a joint venture to establish an osat unit for chip packaging and testing, with foxconn investing $37.2 million for a 40% stake. this comes after the foxconn–vedanta attempt to build a $19.5 billion fab in gujarat, which was shelved in 2023 due to slow progress and the search for a technology partner. foxconn remains “committed to india” and is now seeking new partners and applying under india’s incentive scheme to set up semiconductor manufacturing using mature nodes (e.g. 40 nm) for applications like automotive electronics. another taiwanese firm, psmc, as noted, is partnering with tata for the 28 nm fab – bringing in foundry expertise and marking a major foreign collaboration. japan’s semiconductor industry is involved as well. renesas electronics (japan) has teamed up with india’s cg power and thailand’s sterling & wilson (through stars microelectronics) to establish a semiconductor atmp unit in gujarat for specialized chips, with a ₹7,600 crore (≈$920 million) investment. renesas will provide technology for manufacturing microcontrollers, analog and power semiconductors, targeting automotive, industrial and consumer applications. this partnership underscores a trend of foreign tech transfer: renesas’ expertise in automotive chips will help india produce chips for cars and power electronics locally. other global players are strengthening india’s semiconductor ecosystem primarily via r\\&amp;d and design centers, which complements chiplet development. for instance, applied materials (usa) is investing $400 million in an engineering center in bengaluru, and amd (usa) is investing $400 million to expand its india design center – now the company’s largest globally. while these investments are in chip design and research (not fabrication), they focus on areas like advanced chip architectures (ai, gpus, etc.) that often use chiplet designs. ibm (usa) has signed agreements with the indian government to become a knowledge partner for the india semiconductor mission; ibm is helping establish a semiconductor research center that will promote innovation in advanced packaging and heterogeneous integration (the core of chiplet technology). this collaboration aims to share ibm’s expertise in chip design and packaging, fostering local capability in 3d ic and chiplets. these partnerships, along with others in the pipeline (such as ongoing india–japan and india–us dialogues), are accelerating technology transfer and joint ventures, positioning india as an emerging destination for semiconductor assembly and potentially chiplet manufacturing. ready to

your consultation 2. market and industry data indian chiplet market size and growth india’s chiplet market is currently at a nascent stage but is poised for rapid growth this decade. as of now, india represents a very small share of the global chiplet market (since domestic production of chiplet-based devices is minimal), but projections indicate an explosive rise as ecosystem investments bear fruit. market studies project the india chiplet market to grow at ~77.8% cagr from 2023 to 2030 – one of the fastest growth rates worldwide. this growth will be driven by new domestic packaging and assembly capacity coming online (such as micron’s and tata’s plants) and increasing demand from indian industries for high-performance chips. by comparison, the overall asia-pacific chiplet market (dominated by china, taiwan, south korea and japan) is expected to grow at ~76% cagr in the same period. china currently leads adoption in the region – it dominated the asia-pacific chiplet market in 2022 and is on track to achieve a market value of about $48 billion by 2030, thanks to heavy investments in 5g, ai, and chip manufacturing. india’s absolute chiplet market size in 2030 is projected to remain smaller than china’s, but the high growth rate reflects india’s low base and the strong upside as new capacity and use-cases develop. in the broader semiconductor context, india’s semiconductor consumption market (which includes all chips, not just chiplets) is expected to reach $52 billion in 2024-25 and grow to ~$103 billion by 2030. this represents a ~13% cagr in semiconductor demand, driven by industries like mobile devices, it, automotive, and industrial electronics. a portion of this growing demand will shift toward chiplet-based components as they become more common in advanced products. currently, most high-end chips (including chiplet-based processors) are imported; however, as local packaging plants become operational (e.g. micron’s 2025 timeline) and if planned fabs come online by late decade, india could start supplying a share of its own demand. global chiplet market comparison globally, the chiplet market is expanding exponentially as the semiconductor industry embraces modular architectures. in 2023, the global chiplet market was valued around $6.5 billion, but it is forecast to reach $148 billion by 2028 – an astonishing ~86.7% cagr in five years. some long-term forecasts are even more bullish; for instance, one analysis projects the market to surge to $1.72 trillion by 2032 (over 70% cagr) as chiplet-based designs become ubiquitous in high-performance computing and ai hardware. while estimates vary, all agree on strong double- or triple-digit growth driven by industry-wide adoption of chiplets to overcome the limits of moore’s law. in this global landscape, asia-pacific is currently the leading region for chiplet technology by revenue, accounting for roughly 40% of the market (as of 2024). this is unsurprising given that major chip manufacturers and packagers in taiwan, south korea, and china are at the forefront of advanced packaging. the united states and taiwan are key players in chiplet innovation: u.s. companies like amd and intel pioneered chiplet-based cpus (e.g. epyc and ryzen series), and u.s. government initiatives (chips act) are channeling funds into chiplet-related manufacturing and r\\&amp;d. taiwan’s tsmc and ase group lead in 2.5d/3d packaging technologies that enable chiplet integration. china is rapidly ramping up chiplet capabilities as well – for example, chinese firms are using chiplets in 5g network equipment, edge computing devices, and even smart city infrastructure, and china is reportedly “ramping up purchases of chip packaging equipment” to bolster large-scale chiplet manufacturing. in comparison, india’s chiplet segment is still in an infancy stage; india contributed only around 1% of global semiconductor trade in recent years and an even smaller fraction in advanced packaging. however, india’s government and industry are aiming to leverage the global shift to chiplets as a jump-start opportunity, much like india leapfrogged in mobile telecom. by focusing on assembly, packaging and design (rather than immediately on cutting-edge fabs), india seeks to integrate into this burgeoning chiplet supply chain. india’s competitive advantages india’s push into chiplet manufacturing builds on several competitive advantages. first is the extensive semiconductor design talent pool: roughly 20% of the world’s chip designers are based in india, working for firms like intel, qualcomm, amd, and many startups. this large skilled workforce in chip design can be harnessed to develop chiplet architectures and ip blocks locally. the presence of established design r\\&amp;d centers (as noted with amd, google tensor team, etc. in india) means india understands the design requirements for chiplet-based systems, which is a critical piece of the value chain. secondly, india offers a cost advantage and government support. the government’s incentive schemes (discussed in the next section) significantly reduce capital costs for setting up packaging and fab units – e.g. 50% capital subsidy for fabs and 30%+ for atmp facilities. combined with relatively lower labor costs, this can make india an attractive location for labor-intensive chip assembly and testing activities. the geopolitical climate also favors india as an alternative manufacturing hub (a “china+1” strategy). india’s large domestic electronics market (projected to be one of the largest consumers of semiconductors) provides assurance of local demand for any chiplet-based components made in india. additionally, india has strengths in software and systems integration – important for co-designing chiplet systems and the software that runs on them, especially in domains like ai and telecommunications. challenges facing india’s chiplet industry despite optimism, india faces significant challenges in establishing a robust chiplet manufacturing industry. a major hurdle is the lack of existing semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure – india does not yet have an operational advanced node semiconductor fab, and its legacy fab (scl chandigarh) is on older technology. building new fabs and advanced packaging facilities from scratch is capital-intensive and time-consuming, requiring coordination among numerous stakeholders. the lead times for facilities like the tata-psmc fab mean india’s own chiplet-enabled silicon (at 28 nm) won’t roll out until at least 2025-2027. in the interim, india must rely on foreign-made wafers/dies and focus on packaging those – which limits the value capture. another challenge is the shortage of specialized semiconductor manufacturing talent and supporting supply chain. india has abundant chip design engineers, but a dearth of experienced fab engineers, technicians, and assembly experts. as one industry analysis noted, india is “currently facing [an] alarming shortage of skilled workforce” in semiconductor manufacturing, along with infrastructure gaps. training or importing talent is necessary to run fabs and atmps at yield. moreover, key raw materials and equipment for chiplet integration (photolithography tools, advanced substrates, etc.) are not produced in india and will have to be imported, raising costs and logistical complexity. competition from established semiconductor hubs is also stiff. countries like taiwan, south korea, and the us have years of head-start in chiplet and 3d packaging technologies, backed by strong industrial ecosystems. for india to win investments, it must offer not just subsidies but also consistent policies, reliable power and water supply, and ip protection. past attempts (such as the stalled vedanta-foxconn fab and other proposals) show that securing a technology partner is crucial – india needs to convince top-tier firms (like tsmc, intel, or stmicro) to transfer know-how, which can be challenging. finally, the high capital cost of chiplet-capable fabs and packaging lines could be a bottleneck if not met with sustained funding; a single advanced packaging line can cost billions, and maintaining cutting-edge capability (for example, adopting the latest interposer or hybrid bonding techniques) will require continuous investment. despite these challenges, the outlook remains cautiously optimistic: with strong government push and global companies looking to diversify manufacturing, india has a window of opportunity to carve out a niche in chiplet assembly and integration. 3. specific applications and demand trends for chiplets in india chiplets are a modular approach to building complex chips, and their use cases span many high-tech industries. globally, high-performance computing (hpc) and artificial intelligence are primary drivers for chiplet adoption, and this trend is mirrored in india’s tech ecosystem. as india builds out data centers and supercomputing capabilities, there is rising demand for server cpus and ai accelerators that use chiplet architectures. for example, modern server processors like amd epyc or intel xeon chips (widely used in cloud data centers) integrate multiple chiplets to boost core counts and performance. indian data center operators and cloud providers (including global players setting up regions in india) are deploying such chiplet-based cpus to support cloud services and ai workloads. the proliferation of data centers worldwide – india included – is cited as a key driver for the chiplet industry’s growth. in ai, the need for specialized hardware is acute; chiplets allow mixing of processing cores and ai accelerators. this means ai startups and research labs in india can benefit from chips that combine, say, a cpu chiplet with a custom ai coprocessor chiplet. as generative ai and machine learning adoption grows in india (e.g. in cloud ai platforms or edge ai for smart industries), demand will increase for these high-performance multi-die chips. another domain seeing chiplet use is consumer electronics and mobile devices, which is highly relevant given india’s huge smartphone market. chiplet designs can improve power efficiency and customize features in devices. already, smartphones and tablets are starting to leverage multi-chip packages – for instance, to integrate modem, processor, and ai engine dies. this modular design helps manage heat and yields. industry reports indicate that the consumer electronics sector is set to dominate the global chiplet market in coming years, fueled by demand for high-performance yet energy-efficient phones, tablets, and laptops. in india, where over 150 million smartphones are sold annually, manufacturers could eventually adopt chiplets to differentiate their products (for now, most phone socs are monolithic, but chiplet approaches may appear in future 5g or ai-intensive phones). additionally, the rise of wearables and smart home devices in india contributes to iot growth – chiplets can be used to pack more functionality into these small form-factor gadgets. for instance, a wearable might use a chiplet-based sip (system-in-package) to include sensor hubs, processors, and connectivity in one compact module. the automotive sector in india is an emerging area where chiplets could play a role. cars are increasingly “computers on wheels,” requiring chips for engine control, infotainment, adas (advanced driver assistance), and electric vehicle battery management. modern vehicles require efficient processors for autonomous driving and real-time analytics, and chiplets provide a flexible way to achieve the needed performance and integration. in india, the push for electric vehicles (evs) and connected cars means new demand for automotive semiconductors. chiplet-based designs allow mixing high-performance processors with safety-critical microcontrollers or analog components. notably, the renesas-cg facility being set up in gujarat plans to manufacture chips for automotive and power applications using chiplet-like multi-die packaging (to integrate power management, microcontroller, and connectivity functions). as indian automotive companies (and global oems in india) advance toward adas and eventually autonomous features, they will likely utilize chiplet-based controllers and sensors, supplied either by local packaging units or imported. beyond these, a range of industrial and networking applications in india stand to benefit from chiplets. the telecommunications sector, for example, with 5g rollout, needs high-performance networking gear. base stations and network switches can use chiplets to combine processors, accelerators, and i/o dies for better throughput. the rise of 5g and edge computing in india is creating opportunities for customized chiplet solutions – as seen globally, “the rise in demand for ai, 5g, and iot applications fuels chiplet adoption.” in industrial automation, factories implementing industry 4.0 will use edge devices and plcs that could adopt chiplet-based multicore processors to handle complex tasks. healthcare devices and military/aerospace in india (sectors where reliability is key) could also use chiplets; for instance, a defense-grade system-on-module might integrate radar processing and secure elements as separate chiplets in one package. in summary, the key industries for chiplets in india align with global trends: data centers and cloud ai – driving need for chiplet-based cpus and ai accelerators to support cloud services and ai training/inference. consumer electronics (smartphones, pcs, gaming) – looking to chiplets for performance gains and power efficiency in devices; reports highlight that integrating chiplets enables “innovation, compact designs, and efficiency” in consumer devices. automotive and industrial (incl. iot) – requiring heterogeneous integration (mixing logic, analog, power chiplets) for evs, smart vehicles, iot sensors, and automation controllers. telecom and networking – 5g infrastructure and upcoming 6g or networking hardware can use chiplets to meet high bandwidth and low latency requirements. defense and aerospace – strategic applications where on-shore packaging of critical chips (with chiplet tech) could be important for security and customization. india is at the early stage of utilizing chiplets in these sectors. much of the current demand is met by imports (e.g. importing an amd chiplet-based processor for a server, or an ai gpu for a research lab). however, as domestic capability in chiplet packaging improves, we can expect more “made in india” multi-chip modules catering to local industries, especially in automotive and electronics. the government’s emphasis on emerging areas like ai and iot means that demand for chiplet-based solutions in those areas is set to increase swiftly, ensuring a growing market for any local chiplet manufacturing ventures. 4. government policies and incentives policy initiatives: india semiconductor mission and pli scheme the indian government has launched several policy initiatives to support semiconductor and chiplet manufacturing, recognizing it as a strategic industry. in late 2021, the government set up the india semiconductor mission (ism) as a dedicated agency to drive india’s semiconductor program. under this mission, a $10 billion incentive package (pli – production linked incentive scheme for semiconductors and displays) was approved to attract chip fabrication units and atmp/osat facilities. this includes generous capital subsidies: up to 50% of project cost for eligible semiconductor fabs and display fabs, and around 30% of capital expenditure for atmp/osat (chip assembly and packaging) units. for example, the ism’s modified program offers to cover half the cost of establishing fabs at mature nodes, which was a key factor in recent proposals (tata-psmc fab, vedanta-foxconn earlier). states complement this with their own incentives (such as subsidized land, electricity, and additional capital grants like gujarat’s 20% for the micron plant). alongside fabrication, the government introduced a design-linked incentive (dli) scheme to encourage domestic semiconductor design (including startups working on chiplet ip). this scheme provides financial support (such as reimbursements for design house expenses and product development) to make india a hub for chip design. the idea is to create a pipeline of indian-designed chiplets and chips that could eventually be manufactured or packaged in india. by mid-2023, seeing the intense global competition, the government indicated that it would expand and extend these incentives. in september 2024, ism’s ceo announced a “fresh incentives package” was in the works, likely exceeding another $10 billion, to support the industry for the next 10 years. this new package is set to broaden support to the entire ecosystem, including semiconductor components and materials, not just fabs, reflecting a more holistic approach. the goal is to have at least 5 more fabs and multiple packaging units by the end of the decade, which will require sustained incentive outlays. in essence, india’s policy framework (pli and related schemes) heavily subsidizes capital investment, shares risk with investors, and provides infrastructure support to anyone setting up semiconductor manufacturing or advanced packaging in india. these policies specifically mention “advanced packaging” and “chiplets” as focus areas, underscoring that india aims to leap into the chiplet era rather than only chasing cutting-edge fab nodes. government incentives and investments the government incentives have translated into concrete support for chiplet-related manufacturing projects. as noted, micron’s atmp project is funded roughly 70% by central and state funds combined. similarly, the approved units under ism are all receiving significant subsidies: e.g., the tata-psmc fab (₹91,000 crore investment) will get 50% of capital from the government, and the tata tsat packaging plant (₹27,000 crore) will get around 50-70% government funding as well. the ism’s strategy has been to share the upfront cost burden, making india a financially attractive location. in addition to cost-sharing, other incentives include tax breaks (semiconductor manufacturing is eligible for lower corporate tax rates of 17% in india, and often enjoys tax holidays), as well as infrastructure facilitation like setting up electronics manufacturing clusters with ready facilities. for instance, the dholera special investment region in gujarat, where the tata fab will be, is being developed with state support for power and water specifically for the fab’s needs. the government is also directly investing in skilling and research which indirectly incentivizes the industry. it has announced the semiconindia program, which includes funding for training 85,000 semiconductor professionals in the country and partnerships with institutes to launch semiconductor education curricula. such workforce development is effectively an incentive for companies, as it ensures a pipeline of talent. additionally, india’s public r\\&amp;d institutions (like c-dac and iits) have been allocated funds to work on areas like chiplet integration, 3d ic design, and compound semiconductors. the aim is to foster innovation that companies in india can utilize. for example, c-dac is working on indigenous processor ip (the dir-v risc-v initiative) and exploring collaborations with ibm to possibly adopt or co-develop high-performance processors for india, which might involve chiplet designs for hpc. it’s worth noting that state governments are aggressively competing to host these projects by sweetening deals. gujarat, maharashtra, karnataka, tamil nadu, and telangana have all rolled out special policies for semiconductor and electronics. this includes reimbursement of gst, stamp duty waivers for land, subsidized loans, etc., on top of central incentives. the cumulative incentives can often cover 70-75% of a project’s cost, as seen in micron’s case. such generous support underscores how strategically important chip manufacturing is viewed in india’s policy circles. international collaborations and technology transfer india is actively engaging with foreign governments and companies to facilitate technology transfer and collaboration in semiconductors, which is crucial for catching up in chiplet and advanced packaging know-how. a landmark development is the india–usa semiconductor partnership forged in 2023. under the u.s. chips and science act, a portion of funding (the international technology security and innovation fund) has been earmarked to help allies build up semiconductor capacity. the us government has decided to partner with india’s ism using this fund – about $100 million per year until 2027 – specifically to boost india’s assembly, testing, and packaging capabilities. this collaboration will start with the u.s. helping assess india’s ecosystem and identifying gaps, and is expected to lead to joint initiatives in workforce training, standards development, and possibly co-investment in facilities. the motive on the u.s. side is to diversify supply chains away from china, and on the indian side to leapfrog into advanced packaging leadership. this partnership has already resulted in indian delegations visiting u.s. packaging labs and an agreement to set up a training program for indian engineers in american semiconductor fabs and atmp plants. india has also deepened ties with japan in this field. in july 2023, india and japan signed a memorandum of cooperation on semiconductor supply chain partnership. japan, which has expertise in materials, equipment, and mature node chips, is working with india to potentially set up facilities (for example, there were reports that a japanese consortium may assist in a 65 nm analog fab in india). japanese companies like tokyo electron (a major equipment maker) have partnered with tata to supply tools for the upcoming fab, and others are exploring joint ventures in packaging. the india-japan collaboration extends to research – the two governments are funding joint research projects on advanced packaging and chiplet integration, and have initiated talent exchange programs (indian engineers training in japan’s tech institutes). similarly, european and taiwanese collaborations are in progress. the eu “chips act” has a provision for international cooperation, and companies like stmicroelectronics (europe) and tsmc (taiwan) have been in discussions to either invest in india or help through technical consultancy. in fact, as part of its post-foxconn strategy, india encouraged stmicro to be a tech partner in an indian fab; while st did not take equity, it was willing to license technology to vedanta-foxconn, and may yet partner with foxconn or vedanta separately. additionally, belgium’s research hub imec and france’s cea-leti have signed mous with indian institutions to advise on setting up a semiconductor research center that includes 3d packaging test lines. another notable collaboration is with israel: the stalled ismc analog fab project in karnataka involved tower semiconductor (israel) as a partner. with intel’s takeover of tower failing, that project may revive with direct intel involvement or other israeli expertise. israel and india have also discussed working together on heterogeneous integration for defense electronics (where chiplets could be vital). finally, the indian government’s outreach to global industry is evident in events like the semiconindia conference, where ceos of intel, amd, arm, and others participated and pledged support. the government often highlights that companies setting up in india will not just serve the local market but also export, leveraging india’s strategic location and trade partnerships. in summary, international collaboration – whether via direct investment (micron, foxconn, renesas), government-to-government agreements (us, japan), or research partnerships (ibm, imec) – is a cornerstone of india’s strategy. it accelerates technology transfer in chiplet manufacturing

    "searchMaterial": "the cost of inaction: why delaying tech investment is risky the financial implications of not modernizing business processes. \n      in india's rapidly digitizing economy, businesses that fail to modernize or adopt technology face significant financial risks, including inefficiencies, higher costs, and declining customer satisfaction. according to a recent pwc digital factory transformation survey, indian companies lagging in digital adoption incur notably higher operational costs compared to tech-savvy competitors (pwc india, 2023). a 2024 industry report found that digitally mature businesses achieve substantial cost savings and higher customer satisfaction scores (mckinsey, 2024). this blog explores the financial implications of not modernizing business processes, using data and surveys to highlight gaps in efficiency, cost savings, and customer satisfaction. discover recent real-world case studies from india (2023-2024) to understand how companies transformed their operations through digitization and achieved measurable outcomes. the cost of not digitizing: insights from data and surveys efficiency gaps: a 2023 nasscom report revealed that indian msmes without digital tools experience lower operational efficiency, with manual processes leading to delays and errors (nasscom, 2023). for example, businesses relying on paper-based workflows take considerably longer to process orders compared to those using digital tools. cost savings missed: the pwc digital factory transformation survey (2023) found that indian manufacturing companies adopting digital solutions achieve a notable reduction in production costs, while non-digital firms face rising expenses due to inefficiencies. mckinsey (2024) estimates that digitally mature businesses save a significant percentage on labor costs through automation. customer satisfaction decline: a 2024 forrester survey indicated that a majority of indian consumers prefer businesses with digital interfaces, and non-digital firms report considerably lower customer satisfaction scores (forrester, 2024). manual processes often lead to slower response times and poor service quality, driving customers to competitors. the financial implications are clear: businesses that fail to digitize risk higher costs, lost efficiency, and declining customer loyalty. the following recent case studies from india demonstrate how companies overcame these challenges through tech investment. case study 1: mankind pharma digitizes supply chain for cost efficiency (2023-2024) problem statement mankind pharma, a delhi-based pharmaceutical company, struggled with manual supply chain processes, leading to inefficiencies in inventory management and distribution. manual tracking caused stockouts and overstocking, increasing costs and delaying deliveries to retailers. before digitization, mankind pharma had an inventory turnover ratio of approximately 5.0, operational costs of around ₹15 crore annually (approximate, based on industry studies), a distribution reach of about 20,000 retailers, and a customer satisfaction rate of approximately 72% (approximate, based on industry studies) (mankind pharma, 2024). solution in 2023, mankind pharma implemented a cloud-based erp system to digitize supply chain management. iot sensors monitored inventory levels in real time, while data analytics optimized reorder points and distribution routes. a mobile app enabled retailers to place orders, improving accessibility. cloud solutions centralized data, ensuring security through encryption. employee training programs facilitated adoption, and partnerships with logistics providers streamlined deliveries. the digitization focused on cost efficiency, scalability, and customer satisfaction. results achieved inventory turnover ratio: improved from approximately 5.0 to 5.8 within 12 months (mankind pharma, 2024). operational costs: decreased from around ₹15 crore to ₹12.5 crore annually (approximate, based on industry studies), saving around 17% through efficiency gains. distribution reach: expanded from about 20,000 to 25,000 retailers, driven by optimized logistics (mankind pharma, 2024). customer satisfaction rate: increased from approximately 72% to 82% (approximate, based on industry studies), supported by reliable product availability. digitization enabled mankind pharma to reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction, avoiding financial losses. case study 2: shopclues digitizes e-commerce for customer satisfaction (2023-2024) problem statement shopclues, a gurugram-based e-commerce platform, struggled with manual processes for order processing and customer support, leading to high operational costs and declining satisfaction. manual workflows delayed responses and impacted competitiveness, particularly in tier-2 and tier-3 markets. before digitization, shopclues had a monthly active user base of approximately 1 million, and the customer satisfaction rate was below 90%. solution in 2023, shopclues implemented a cloud-based order management system and ai-driven customer support tools. ai chatbots handled queries, reducing response times, while cloud solutions centralized data, ensuring security through encryption. seo and social media campaigns targeted tier-2 and tier-3 audiences, and regional language content improved accessibility. employee training facilitated adoption, and partnerships with local influencers built trust. results achieved monthly active users: grew from approximately 1 million to 1.3 million within 24 months (shopclues, 2024). customer satisfaction rate: increased from around 68% to 80% (approximate, based on industry studies), supported by faster services. digitization enabled shopclues to reduce costs, enhance efficiency, and improve customer satisfaction, avoiding financial losses. case study 3: godrej agrovet digitizes agricultural supply chain for efficiency (2023-2024) problem statement godrej agrovet, a mumbai-based agrochemical company, faced inefficiencies in manual supply chain processes, leading to high costs and delays in distribution to

    "content": "<p>Picture this: a promising Indian startup, on the verge of scaling to new heights, suddenly finds itself in the headlines—not for its innovation, but for a devastating cybersecurity breach.</p>\n<p>In 2024, several Indian startups faced this nightmare, with breaches costing them over ₹50 crore each. These incidents weren’t just financial setbacks; they were wake-up calls for the entire startup ecosystem.</p>\n<p>If you’re running a startup or scaling a business, these stories will make you rethink your cybersecurity strategy. But here’s the surprising part: these breaches weren’t caused by sophisticated hackers using cutting-edge tools.</p>\n<p>They were often the result of overlooked vulnerabilities and missed opportunities to implement basic tech safeguards. Let’s dive into three cybersecurity breaches that shook Indian startups in 2024, the staggering costs they incurred, and the lesser-known lessons that could save your business from a similar fate.</p>\n<h2>1. WazirX: The $235 Million Crypto Heist That Shocked the Nation\n</h2>\n<p>In July 2024, WazirX, one of India’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, suffered a catastrophic cybersecurity breach that resulted in the theft of $235 million (approximately ₹1,960 crore) in digital assets.</p>\n<p>Yes, you read that right—₹1,960 crore. This breach wasn’t just a financial blow; it was a seismic event that rattled investor confidence and highlighted the vulnerabilities in India’s booming crypto sector.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the \"wow\" moment:</strong> the breach wasn’t caused by a lone hacker or a sophisticated attack. It was traced back to a compromised third-party wallet provider, Liminal, which WazirX relied on for storing user funds.</p>\n<p>According to reports, the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Liminal’s multi-signature wallet system, draining funds from over 400 cryptocurrency wallets in a matter of hours.</p>\n<p>What’s even more surprising? WazirX had reportedly conducted security audits, but the breach exposed gaps in their third-party risk management—a blind spot that cost them dearly.</p>\n<p>The financial impact was staggering, but the ripple effects were even worse. WazirX faced a liquidity crisis, suspended withdrawals, and saw its user base erode as trust evaporated.</p>\n<p>The breach also sparked regulatory scrutiny, with India’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) launching an investigation into the incident.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong></p>\n<p>If your startup relies on third-party vendors, especially for sensitive operations like payments or data storage, you’re only as secure as your weakest link.</p>\n<p>Conduct rigorous third-party risk assessments and ensure your vendors meet the highest security standards. The cost of a breach far outweighs the investment in vetting your partners.</p>\n<h2>2. Angel One: The Multi-Crore Data Breach That Exposed Millions</h2>\n<p>In October 2024, Angel One, a leading Indian stockbroking platform, suffered a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of 7.9 million customers.</p>\n<p>The financial cost? A staggering mutli-crore in direct damages, including regulatory fines, legal fees, and compensation to affected users. But the real damage was to the company’s reputation, which is harder to quantify.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the surprising twist:</strong> the breach wasn’t caused by a complex cyberattack. It was the result of a simple misconfiguration in Angel One’s cloud storage system, which left sensitive customer data—names, addresses, phone numbers, and even stock holdings—exposed on the dark web.</p>\n<p><strong>And here’s the \"wow\" moment:</strong> the vulnerability had been flagged by cybersecurity researchers months earlier, but Angel One failed to act in time.</p>\n<p>The aftermath was brutal. The breach led to a significant drop in Angel One’s stock price, a flood of customer complaints.</p>\n<p>What’s even more alarming? A 2024 report by PwC revealed that 54% of Indian startups have similar cloud misconfigurations, making them sitting ducks for cybercriminals.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong></p>\n<p>Cloud security isn’t optional—it’s essential. Regularly audit your cloud infrastructure for misconfigurations and ensure your team is trained to respond to vulnerabilities quickly.</p>\n<p>A small oversight can lead to a massive financial hit, and in India’s regulatory environment, the penalties are only getting stricter.</p>\n<h2>3. BSNL: The Major Data Leak That Exposed National Security Risks</h2>\n<p>In mid-2024, Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), a state-owned telecom giant with a significant startup-like digital transformation arm, suffered a data breach that exposed over 278 GB of sensitive data.</p>\n<p>While BSNL isn’t a traditional startup, its digital initiatives and reliance on startup-like agility make this breach a cautionary tale for the ecosystem. The financial cost? Estimated at over substantial amount, including the cost of mitigation, legal battles, and lost business opportunities.</p>\n<p><strong>Here’s the \"wow\" moment:</strong> the breach wasn’t just about customer data—it exposed critical national security information, including international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) numbers, SIM card details, and home location register data.</p>\n<p>The attackers, operating under the alias \"kiberphant0m,\" claimed to have accessed server snapshots that could be used for SIM cloning and extortion. What’s even more surprising? This was BSNL’s second major breach in less than a year, following a similar incident in December 2023.</p>\n<p>The fallout was severe. BSNL faced intense scrutiny from the Indian government, with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) ordering a full investigation. The breach also led to a notable impact on operations, costing the company a considerable sum in lost revenue.</p>\n<p><strong>What This Means for You:</strong><br />\nIf your startup handles sensitive data—whether it’s customer information or proprietary technology—don’t underestimate the risks. Invest in robust encryption, multi-factor authentication, and regular penetration testing.</p>\n<p><strong>And here’s a lesser-known tip:</strong> consider cyber insurance. In 2024, Indian startups with cyber insurance were able to recover up to 60% of their breach-related costs, according to a report by the Data Security Council of India (DSCI).</p>\n<p><strong>The Takeaway:</strong> <strong>Cybersecurity Isn’t a Luxury—It’s a Lifeline</strong></p>\n<p>These three cybersecurity breaches—inflicting massive financial losses on WazirX, a substantial hit on Angel One, and BSNL—aren’t just cautionary tales; they serve as a blueprint for what not to do. The surprising truth?</p>\n<p>These incidents weren’t caused by unbeatable hackers or insurmountable challenges. They were the result of overlooked vulnerabilities, missed opportunities, and a lack of proactive tech implementation.</p>\n<p>But here’s the silver lining: you can avoid their fate. By investing in third-party risk management, cloud security, and robust data protection measures, you can protect your startup from the financial and reputational damage of a breach.<br />\nAnd in India’s startup ecosystem, where competition is fierce and trust is hard-earned, cybersecurity isn’t just a defense—it’s a competitive advantage.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/year-ender-2024-biggest-cyberattacks-in-india/articleshow/116796935.cms?from=mdr\"><em>Economic Times: \"Year Ender 2024: Biggest Cyberattacks in India\" (December 2024)</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thecyberexpress.com/top-15-cyberattacks-that-rocked-india/\"><em>The Cyber Express: \"The Top 15 Cyberattacks That Rocked India in 2024\" (August 2024)</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.pwc.in/digital-trust-insights-india.html\"><em>PwC India: \"2024 Global Digital Trust Insights Survey\" (2024)</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.medianama.com/2024/12/223-india-faced-370-million-malware-1-million-ransomware-incidents-in-2024-report/#:~:text=India%20faced%20approximately%20370%20million,DSCI)%20and%20cybersecurity%20firm%20Seqrite.\"><em>Data Security Council of India (DSCI): \"Cyber Threats: India Faces 370 Million Malware Attacks in 2024\" (2024)</em></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.techcircle.in/2024/12/24/rewind-2024-major-cyber-attacks-that-shook-india-this-year\"><em>TechCircle: \"Rewind 2024: Major Cyber-Attacks That Shook India This Year\" (December 2024)</em></a></li>\n</ol>",

    "content": "<h2 id=\"aboutthecustomer\">About The Customer</h2>\n<p>The company, a global leader in the supply chain of building materials, faced a significant operational challenge due to the vast diversity and volume of its stock-keeping units (SKUs), which exceed 100,000. With vendors across 35 countries, the complexity of their inventory management was compounded by frequent inquiries from customers who sent photographs of home furnishing SKUs, asking about availability and lead times. These photographs often feature intricate designs (imagine different wood patterns on table tops or doors), including specific veneer line patterns and colors that require precise matching.</p>\n<p>Their process to match each customer-submitted image with the correct SKU was time-consuming and prone to errors. The errors were further exacerbated by variations in image quality — pictures were often taken by phone cameras of varying resolutions, unsuitable lighting conditions, and different camera angles. Images were often blurred, not showing the intricate line patterns. Staff members spent days trying to identify matches manually, a task that not only slowed down response times but often led to the procurement of incorrect designs or missing out on the right options. Dissatisfied customers were common, impacting the company’s reputation and operational efficiency.</p>\n<h2 id=\"technicalcomplexityandsolutiondesign\">Technical Complexity and Solution Design</h2>\n<p>The solution needed to stem the errors and save the huge operational effort the company was spending on this activity.</p>\n<p>Artificial Intelligence was needed to play a role here. However, the technology had its limitations. It was not an ordinary problem where an approximate image match would have sufficed. A major re-engineering effort was needed since we were tasked with finding exact matches after comparing a low-quality image against 100,000+ SKUs, and we aimed to do it in under 3 minutes. Moreover, the operational costs had to be kept low.</p>\n<p>And that is exactly what our team delivered — a cloud-based solution that could scale using microservices, leveraged open-source computer vision models, combined with proprietary machine learning approaches. The first step was to get around the image quality problem - here, we combined elaborate image engineering methods with fine-tuned convolutional neural nets to process images from varying resolutions, under different light conditions, and in some cases, even images with filters on them. To keep costs low, the entire solution was designed to run as a secure, serverless solution providing matches on-demand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoutcome\">The Outcome</h2>\n<p>The customer has gained over 99% operational efficiency in the pattern-matching process. The pattern matches done by our solution were found to be 70% more accurate during our benchmarking tests.

    "searchMaterial": "empowering supply chain businesses with advanced ai: a look at our image matching technology unveiling the technical intricacies and transformative potential of our ai-driven image matching solution \n      about the customer the company, a global leader in the supply chain of building materials, faced a significant operational challenge due to the vast diversity and volume of its stock-keeping units (skus), which exceed 100,000. with vendors across 35 countries, the complexity of their inventory management was compounded by frequent inquiries from customers who sent photographs of home furnishing skus, asking about availability and lead times. these photographs often feature intricate designs (imagine different wood patterns on table tops or doors), including specific veneer line patterns and colors that require precise matching. their process to match each customer-submitted image with the correct sku was time-consuming and prone to errors. the errors were further exacerbated by variations in image quality — pictures were often taken by phone cameras of varying resolutions, unsuitable lighting conditions, and different camera angles. images were often blurred, not showing the intricate line patterns. staff members spent days trying to identify matches manually, a task that not only slowed down response times but often led to the procurement of incorrect designs or missing out on the right options. dissatisfied customers were common, impacting the company’s reputation and operational efficiency. technical complexity and solution design the solution needed to stem the errors and save the huge operational effort the company was spending on this activity. artificial intelligence was needed to play a role here. however, the technology had its limitations. it was not an ordinary problem where an approximate image match would have sufficed. a major re-engineering effort was needed since we were tasked with finding exact matches after comparing a low-quality image against 100,000+ skus, and we aimed to do it in under 3 minutes. moreover, the operational costs had to be kept low. and that is exactly what our team delivered — a cloud-based solution that could scale using microservices, leveraged open-source computer vision models, combined with proprietary machine learning approaches. the first step was to get around the image quality problem - here, we combined elaborate image engineering methods with fine-tuned convolutional neural nets to process images from varying resolutions, under different light conditions, and in some cases, even images with filters on them. to keep costs low, the entire solution was designed to run as a secure, serverless solution providing matches on-demand. the outcome the customer has gained over 99% operational efficiency in the pattern-matching process. the pattern matches done by our solution were found to be 70% more accurate during our benchmarking tests. their operational resources are optimised and their turn around time to customer queries has reduced drastically, resulting in better customer satisfaction. ready to transform your operations with ai? reach out to us today and discover how our tailored ai solutions can elevate your business to the next level.

    "content": "<p>Blockchain is a technology to store data in a very secure and decentralized manner. It works by a consensus algorithm that adds a piece of data on the blockchain with every block that needs to be validated. The validation happens through many different nodes without relying on a central entity. Due to this architecture it comes with some challenges.</p>\n<p>In this blog we will discuss one such key challenge and its solution without which we can’t achieve complete decentralization.</p>\n<h2 id=\"whatisanoracle\">What is an Oracle ?</h2>\n<p>In medieval times oracles were people with magical abilities or objects who could provide wise and reliable guidance to those in need. Typical conversation between an oracle and peoples would be like:</p>\n<p><em class=\"text-gray-500 font-normal\"> Ancient one (not from marvel): What would the future look like ?</em>\n<br/>\n<em class=\"text-gray-500 \"> Oracle (waving over a crystal ball): In future the world will work on chain of blocks :p</em></p>\n<p>Similarly in the technology space servers have the data we can fetch them when needed. We use apis as an oracle to fetch data from the server and apis are powered by magical spells that we call code.</p>\n<p>An example would be when a developer needs weather data or currency exchange rates we rely on third party apis which we can call over an http request. So here, the apis are your oracle.</p>\n<p>Blockchain can leverage these apis too but that comes with a big risk. It will also shatter the core principle of blockchain completely. Let's see why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"theoracleproblem\">The Oracle Problem</h2>\n<p>Using traditional APIs in blockchain environment can lead to some serious failures because</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Fundamentally blockchain can't use apis because blockchain needs to be deterministic. In the real world, the value of currencies or weather fluctuates really fast. So with variable data, blockchain nodes may get different values while validating the transactions. Hence the nodes may be able to build a consensus. Hence the entire chain will fail.</p></li>\n<li><p>Generally apis are hosted on a server which is controlled by a centralized entity so if we use traditional apis we are introducing centralized data to a decentralized network. Which deviates from the main purpose of blockchain i.e decentralization. It will introduce a single point of failure if the centralized source is compromised, if it goes offline or sends faulty data to an on-chain network then the outcome of smart contacts will not be reliable.</p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"solution\">Solution</h2>\n<p>Decentralized oracles provide a way for blockchain and smart contracts to extract data from the real world. They leverage blockchain to establish a network of nodes whose job is to aggregate real world data from various sources then filter it for inaccuracies and come to a consensus of a deterministic value. Then that data gets stored in the blockchain which can be used by other smart contracts.</p>\n<p>By interacting with real world data we can truly unlock the full potential of blockchain hence projects like <a href=\"https://chain.link/\" target=\"_blank\">chainlink</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://bandprotocol.com/\">Band Protocol (BAND)</a> , <a  target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://api3.org/\">api3</a> are developing decentralized oracles to eliminate the oracle problem in the web3 space.</p>\n<h2 id=\"implementation\">Implementation</h2>\n<p>Imagine you are developing a funding smart contract to receive ethereum in your crypto wallet. And you decided that the minimum amount would be 1 USD.</p>\n<p>To apply that constraint,you need to know what's the current exchange rate of ethereum in USD is. As we require real world data here we can use one of the decentralized oracles like Chainlink - which currently is the most decentralized oracle network out there. Lets see a step by step guide to implement the chainlink oracle.</p>\n<p><em class=\"text-gray-600 font-normal\">Complete code is at the end of this article</em></p>\n<p>Lets create a smart contract first</p>\n<pre><code class=\"solidity language-solidity\">// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\npragma solidity ^0.8.0;\n\ncontract ETHtoUSD {\nuint256 minimumValue = 1 \\* 1e18;\n\n    function receiveFund() public payable {\n        require( msg.value &gt;  minimalValue, \"Please send minimum 1 USD.\");\n    }\n\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Here inside ETHtoUSD contract we declared receveFund function with payable keyword which will enable the function to play with ETH transactions.</p>\n<p>The require statement is like a “if then” function where we are saying that if received value is less than minimumValue then throw a message.</p>\n<p>We are reading the value of ETH sent to our smart contract using a global keyword msg.value which gives us the amount in terms of WEI.</p>\n<p><em class=\"text-gray-600 font-normal\">1 ETH = 1^18 WEI</em></p>\n<p>And that's why we taking our minimumValue as 1 * 1e18</p>\n<p>To get current rate of ETH in real world we will interact with chainlink smart contract and to interact with any smart contract we need 2 things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Address of that smart contract</li>\n<li>ABI of smart contract</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First we can get the address easily using <a href=\"https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/\">chainlink documentation</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"/blogImages/decentralized-oracle/chainlink.png\" alt=\"chainlink doc\" /></p>\n<p>We will use address of ETH/USD. For testing we are using the Goerli Testnet.</p>\n<p>Second, to get the ABI we can import the file from their github.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"solidity language-solidity\">import \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol\";\n</code></pre>\n<p>Next, we will create a function to fetch data from oracle.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"solidity language-solidity\">function getPrice() public view returns (uint){\n    AggregatorV3Interface Price = AggregatorV3Interface(0xD4a33860578De61DBAbDc8BFdb98FD742fA7028e);\n    (,int256 price,,,) = Price.latestRoundData();\n    return uint (price * 1e10);\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Using AggredatorV3nterface we are getting the contract functionalities.

    "searchMaterial": "decentralized oracle the oracle problem and it's solution. \n      blockchain is a technology to store data in a very secure and decentralized manner. it works by a consensus algorithm that adds a piece of data on the blockchain with every block that needs to be validated. the validation happens through many different nodes without relying on a central entity. due to this architecture it comes with some challenges. in this blog we will discuss one such key challenge and its solution without which we can’t achieve complete decentralization. what is an oracle ? in medieval times oracles were people with magical abilities or objects who could provide wise and reliable guidance to those in need. typical conversation between an oracle and peoples would be like: ancient one (not from marvel): what would the future look like ? oracle (waving over a crystal ball): in future the world will work on chain of blocks :p similarly in the technology space servers have the data we can fetch them when needed. we use apis as an oracle to fetch data from the server and apis are powered by magical spells that we call code. an example would be when a developer needs weather data or currency exchange rates we rely on third party apis which we can call over an http request. so here, the apis are your oracle. blockchain can leverage these apis too but that comes with a big risk. it will also shatter the core principle of blockchain completely. let's see why. the oracle problem using traditional apis in blockchain environment can lead to some serious failures because fundamentally blockchain can't use apis because blockchain needs to be deterministic. in the real world, the value of currencies or weather fluctuates really fast. so with variable data, blockchain nodes may get different values while validating the transactions. hence the nodes may be able to build a consensus. hence the entire chain will fail. generally apis are hosted on a server which is controlled by a centralized entity so if we use traditional apis we are introducing centralized data to a decentralized network. which deviates from the main purpose of blockchain i.e decentralization. it will introduce a single point of failure if the centralized source is compromised, if it goes offline or sends faulty data to an on-chain network then the outcome of smart contacts will not be reliable. solution decentralized oracles provide a way for blockchain and smart contracts to extract data from the real world. they leverage blockchain to establish a network of nodes whose job is to aggregate real world data from various sources then filter it for inaccuracies and come to a consensus of a deterministic value. then that data gets stored in the blockchain which can be used by other smart contracts. by interacting with real world data we can truly unlock the full potential of blockchain hence projects like chainlink, band protocol (band) , api3 are developing decentralized oracles to eliminate the oracle problem in the web3 space. implementation imagine you are developing a funding smart contract to receive ethereum in your crypto wallet. and you decided that the minimum amount would be 1 usd. to apply that constraint,you need to know what's the current exchange rate of ethereum in usd is. as we require real world data here we can use one of the decentralized oracles like chainlink - which currently is the most decentralized oracle network out there. lets see a step by step guide to implement the chainlink oracle. complete code is at the end of this article lets create a smart contract first // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract ethtousd { uint256 minimumvalue = 1 \\* 1e18; function receivefund() public payable { require( msg.value &gt; minimalvalue, \"please send minimum 1 usd.\"); } } here inside ethtousd contract we declared recevefund function with payable keyword which will enable the function to play with eth transactions. the require statement is like a “if then” function where we are saying that if received value is less than minimumvalue then throw a message. we are reading the value of eth sent to our smart contract using a global keyword msg.value which gives us the amount in terms of wei. 1 eth = 1^18 wei and that's why we taking our minimumvalue as 1 * 1e18 to get current rate of eth in real world we will interact with chainlink smart contract and to interact with any smart contract we need 2 things: address of that smart contract abi of smart contract first we can get the address easily using chainlink documentation we will use address of eth/usd. for testing we are using the goerli testnet. second, to get the abi we can import the file from their github. import \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/aggregatorv3interface.sol\"; next, we will create a function to fetch data from oracle. function getprice() public view returns (uint){ aggregatorv3interface price = aggregatorv3interface(0xd4a33860578de61dbabdc8bfdb98fd742fa7028e); (,int256 price,,,) = price.latestrounddata(); return uint (price * 1e10); } using aggredatorv3nterface we are getting the contract functionalities. then we are using latestrounddata() to get the price result. latestrounddata returns 5 values (roundid, price, startedat, timestamp, answeredinround.) we just need the price data here so we can skip other information using a comma. finally this function will give us a price with 8 decimal places but in msg.value we received the amount in 18 decimal places so to match them up we need to multiply the price with 1e10 and return that. congratulations! you just learned how to use decentralized oracles. we got the latest price information and now we need to convert that into usd. function convertethtousd(uint _ethamount) public view returns(uint){ uint valueprice = getprice(); uint amountindollars =(valueprice * _ethamount) /1e18; return amountindollars; } this function receives _ethamount which is the amount the user will send. in next line we are getting the currency value using our getprice() function then we are converting it into usd using formula (valueprice * _ethamount) /1e18; perfect! now we can wrap this function around msg.value like this require( convertethtousd(msg.value) &gt; minimalvalue, \"please send minimum 1 usd.\"); here is the final code. // spdx-license-identifier: mit pragma solidity ^0.8.0; import \"@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/aggregatorv3interface.sol\"; contract ethtousd { uint256 minimumvalue = 1 * 1e18; function receivefund() public payable { require( convertethtousd(msg.value) &gt; minimalvalue, \"please send minimum 1 usd.\"); } function getprice() public view returns (uint){ aggregatorv3interface price = aggregatorv3interface(0xd4a33860578de61dbabdc8bfdb98fd742fa7028e); (,int256 price,,,) = price.latestrounddata(); return uint (price * 1e18); } function convertethtousd(uint _ethamount) public view returns(uint){ uint valueprice = getlastestprice(); uint amountindollars =(valueprice * _ethamount) /1e18; return amountindollars; } } conclusion the oracle problem is not new to the tech world. we have already seen this in web2 and now are facing the same in web3 but with some extra challenges like decentralization and deterministic values. in this article we saw how to solve this problem, we received real world eth price using chainlink and converted into usd. now it's your turn to go ahead and build something amazing using real world data.

Well, they'll be obsolete in Next 13. Now is this a good step? In most cases, yes. Take the simple code below for example:</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"/blogImages/next13/server-side-props.jpg\"\n  alt=\"Server side prop in Next <=12 vs Next 13\">\n  <figcaption>Server side prop in Next <=12 vs Next 13</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>Apart from making the code more readable, server-side components bring in other advantages, like reducing client-side JavaScript bundle.</p>\n<p>In large production apps with a lot of dependencies, it becomes a painful challenge for developers to reduce the bundle size, that too without compromising on functionalities. With server-side components, a major portion of dependencies never reach client-side, reducing the bundle size drastically.</p>\n<p>Client-side components still have their purpose though, and any component can be made client side by simply adding <code>'use client'</code> as the very first line. Whenever you need to re-render, or use <code>useEffect</code> you can easily make the component client-side.</p>\n<figure>\n  <img\n  src=\"/blogImages/next13/client-side-component.png\"\n  alt=\"Client-side component in Next 13\">\n  <figcaption>Client-side component in Next 13</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2 id=\"anawesomelayoutsystem\">An awesome layout system:</h2>\n<p>Next.js 13 introduces a new layout system at route level.</p>\n<p>For example, we can now have custom layout for all pages in <code>/blog</code> route. Just put the layout in <code>layput.{js/jsx/ts/tsx}</code> under <code>blog</code> folder in <code>pages</code> (or <code>app</code> in Next.13) directory.</p>\n<p>You can even have custom error component, or loading component based on routes. This definitely makes the developer experience way better and easier.

The virtual rotors on the 3D model would move as fast as the rotors on the real pump working hundreds of miles away. The outer surface of the 3D model starts to turn red as the real pump's outer surface heats up. Or if the flow of extracted crude slows down in one of the conduits, the 3D model immediately reflects that slow down too.</p>\n<p>Further, imagine that a 3D model operator, by observing the model, figures out that the increasing heat on the top right surface of the pump is due to degraded coolant viscosity. At a click of a button on the virtual model, the old coolant starts to flush, and is replaced by new flow parallelly - and these events reflect on the actual pump at the same time.</p>\n<p>And if during operations the actual pump shifted its position by 3 cm, the digital twin would also shift by the same amount.</p>\n<p>That is what a digital twin is - a virtual representation that not just reflects the internal and external conditions of an actual product but can also change the behavior of the actual product connected to it over the internet.</p>\n<h2 id=\"howisadigitaltwinused\">How is a digital twin used?</h2>\n<p>Uses of a digital twin range from safety, maintenance, training, and downtime management.</p>\n<p>They are useful in optimizing product performance, understanding the in-service life of a product, performing predictive maintenance, and extending a product’s remaining useful life (RUL).</p>\n<p>After a malfunction, machines deployed in remote locations need to wait longer while engineers arrive and inspect. If on inspection they find that some spare parts will be needed to fix the machine, their transit adds to the downtime costs of the organization. For machines with digital twins, engineers can identify issues remotely, or even assist local engineers to fix them thereby reducing operational losses.</p>\n<p>Training, safety, and expertise are enhanced by training manpower on digital twins simulating the real machines under real working conditions.</p>\n<p>Smart cities are increasingly using digital twins to plan city layouts. Automotive, aerospace and defense are using digital twins to monitor and calibrate remote equipment in real time. The Healthcare industry is aggressively pursuing digital twins to monitor healthcare equipment and patient response. Here is a most interesting video that highlights how human digital twins can enhance personal healthcare.</p>\n<div class=\"yt-container\">\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/H6JzPCbyVSM\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"technologiesusedfordigitaltwins\">Technologies used for digital twins</h2>\n<p>A digital twin setup uses a combination of hardware and software tools.

    "searchMaterial": "industrial digital twins a quick overview of digital twins and their uses in the industry \n      the digital twin market is expected to grow from $7.5 billion in 2022 to $96 billion by 2029 at cagr of 40.6% the top 4 industries adopting digital twins are aerospace &amp; defense, automotive, manufacturing and healthcare 75 percent of organizations surveyed by gartner in 2019 were already using digital twins or planned to within a year what is a digital twin? a digital twin is a virtual representation of a real-world product or system and is identical to the original in its behavior. imagine a 3d, virtual model of a high-speed pump employed in an oil rig, miles off the coast. the virtual rotors on the 3d model would move as fast as the rotors on the real pump working hundreds of miles away. the outer surface of the 3d model starts to turn red as the real pump's outer surface heats up. or if the flow of extracted crude slows down in one of the conduits, the 3d model immediately reflects that slow down too. further, imagine that a 3d model operator, by observing the model, figures out that the increasing heat on the top right surface of the pump is due to degraded coolant viscosity. at a click of a button on the virtual model, the old coolant starts to flush, and is replaced by new flow parallelly - and these events reflect on the actual pump at the same time. and if during operations the actual pump shifted its position by 3 cm, the digital twin would also shift by the same amount. that is what a digital twin is - a virtual representation that not just reflects the internal and external conditions of an actual product but can also change the behavior of the actual product connected to it over the internet. how is a digital twin used? uses of a digital twin range from safety, maintenance, training, and downtime management. they are useful in optimizing product performance, understanding the in-service life of a product, performing predictive maintenance, and extending a product’s remaining useful life (rul). after a malfunction, machines deployed in remote locations need to wait longer while engineers arrive and inspect. if on inspection they find that some spare parts will be needed to fix the machine, their transit adds to the downtime costs of the organization. for machines with digital twins, engineers can identify issues remotely, or even assist local engineers to fix them thereby reducing operational losses. training, safety, and expertise are enhanced by training manpower on digital twins simulating the real machines under real working conditions. smart cities are increasingly using digital twins to plan city layouts. automotive, aerospace and defense are using digital twins to monitor and calibrate remote equipment in real time. the healthcare industry is aggressively pursuing digital twins to monitor healthcare equipment and patient response. here is a most interesting video that highlights how human digital twins can enhance personal healthcare. technologies used for digital twins a digital twin setup uses a combination of hardware and software tools. various iot sensors dot the machine and send real-time data of its working conditions and internal environment to connected cloud servers, where all that data is analyzed using artificial intelligence. augmented reality and virtual reality techniques are used to render 3d models of the model, overlaid with real-life working conditions and with integrated controls to make changes in the real machine if required. special hardware is needed to create 3d models of the machines and their spatial surroundings to be fed into their vr counterparts. conclusion most industries stand to gain a lot through the introduction of digital twin technologies in their systems. the introduction will be initially cost-intensive but is capable of generating multiple times roi by optimizing asset utilization and optimizing planning, safety and responsiveness.

    "searchMaterial": "how metaverse will impact our lives and businesses a description of how metaverse will impact our lives and businesses \n      metaverse explained while your partner makes you wait at the shopping mall, you decide to log onto facebook. the new facebook you have heard so much about. you update the app, click open it, and it asks you to validate yourself. password, your voice, or your retina scan. you're wondering how did it get all these - you're almost scared. but it's facebook. so you move ahead and click login. and lo and behold, the wall and the lists are all gone. you see yourself, in 3d, constructed like a perfect lookalike. for anyone on your friends' list sharing their locations and in the same shopping mall, you see their 3d avatars around you. you of course do not know where they are or what are they shopping or else it will be a blatant invasion of privacy. yet you tap their avatars and a conversation opens between you two. while you're virtually talking, facebook tells you about starbucks in the same mall. you ask your friend if they would like to meet you at starbucks. but they prefer a mccafe - which they saw on their facebook. you agree on mccafe and before you step in there, your friend placed an order for the both of you to mccafe, your money deducted from a blockchain-based wallet that your regulations would have approved. being in india it would be the digital rupee, but mccafe operates on other currencies. the conversion between currencies is made in real-time using a central payment layer integrated into facebook metaverse that can choose the best conversion rates. and what of the cappuccio, 2 big macs, and 1 chocolate muffin you ordered? well, the mccafe inventory updates itself and the supply chain comes into the picture immediately to ensure they do not run out of the good stuff. and when you and your buddy reach the mccafe, there you see your partner sitting, chatting, and laughing with friends while trying dress after dress through their virtual avatars from the lifestyle one floor across them. welcome to the age of metaverse. what is metaverse? a metaverse is a 3d virtual, connected world, that brings our digital experiences closer to your real-life experiences. unlike the internet applications of today, it can connect more diverse services, and experiences in one place so you experience and interact with them as if you were there. contrary to the current disintegrated form of the internet, metaverses will be more driven by platforms rather than disintegrated applications leveraging the common layer of the internet. what impact will metaverse have on businesses? unlike the previous phase of the internet, the metaverse will not impact a few businesses at a time. it will impact more diverse businesses and do it together. for it cannot function with lesser integration. to function effectively, metaverse will have to leverage all the latest technologies available. imagine artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing, augmented and virtual reality, the latest data encryption and transmission technologies powering your telecom service provider, and cpus and servers that can process data much faster than they can today. how will metaverse impact businesses and our lives? 1. personal identity, security, and reducing identity theft tired of a dozen usernames across a dozen websites? imagine your 3d avatar stored as an nft (nonfungible token) and used across all businesses accessing the connected metaverse - after your permission, ideally. the latest computer vision technologies will allow metaverse to create your near-perfect 3d avatar using the pictures, and videos you uploaded. encrypted as a secure hash, they will be stored across central repositories and could be accessed only after an authentication method of your choice - voice, scans, text passwords, or a combination of some. 2. 3d real-time interactions you can buy a bag of chips online, you won't do that for a bike, a car, that expensive jewelry or dress, or a house. what if your 3d avatar could visit the 3d model of a house? you may even be able to see how the sunshine brightens the roof, as unseen by the patron, you lie down on the 3d bed and admire the changing shadows with time. and as you are entering - interact with other 3d avatars in real-time as they are leaving the property, and getting their feedback. priceless. 3. connected inventory, supply chain, and better buying decisions imagine feeling like splurging on yourself on your birthday. your heart stops on that awesome louise vuitton bag. it just goes with your personality, or so you conclude when your beautifully dressed 3d avatar picks it and turns to you so you could size it up. and you just want it. you're instantly all buying options, ranked in the order of price or delivery time. you choose the one from some store, pay using your digital wallet and wait. the store gets the order, gets instant quotes from 3 delivery services again ranked in order of price and delivery time, and the store chooses one. as soon as the bag is picked up from the store physically, the inventory system kicks in and places realtime orders with the supplier to update the required inventory. conclusion the metaverse revolution is a little while away. it will need expensive technology, more connected businesses, and more centralised information. the high operational costs may make it a barrier for small and medium businesses to enter. the concentration of users' information will also add to the already increasing risks to personal identity. for those who are making platforms to do it all will take all the winning share. users, as always, will be in for a treat of experience. many startups specially in asia pacific and the west are building applications on metaverse ideas. it will be interesting to see how they shape our day to day lives.

It is not commonly known that different cloud vendors have their pricing\nsuitable for different workloads. Understanding the application workload profile and corresponding cloud\npricing can mean a saving of as much as 30% on annual cloud costs.</p>\n<p style=\"color:#4285f4\">\nWe compared a few cloud vendors to draw price differences between their components.\n</p>\n<div style=\"display:flex; justify-content: space-around;\" class=\"logoDiv\">\n<img src=\"/blogImages/cloudPrice/A comparison between prices of the major cloud vendors (2).png\" alt=\"aws-logo\" style=\"width:100%\">\n<!-- <img src=\"./AWS-logo-2.jpg\" alt=\"gcp-logo\" style=\"width:15%;height:5%\">\n            <img src=\"./AWS-logo-2.jpg\" alt=\"azure-logo\" style=\"width:15%;height:5%\"> -->\n</div>\n<h2 class=\"text-4xl\">Methodology</h2>\n<h4>Cloud Platforms compared</h4>\n<p>\nWe compared \n<u> <a href='https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator' target='_blank'> Google Cloud Platform (GCP), </a> \n</u>\n<u>\n<a href='https://calculator.aws/#/' target='_blank'>Amazon Web Services (AWS), </a> \n</u> and \n<u> \n<a href='https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/' target='_blank'>Microsoft Azure </a>\n</u> for theirpricing.

    "searchMaterial": "cloud price comparison a comparison between prices of the major cloud vendors \n      the problem most businesses spend more on cloud setups by not knowing which cloud vendor charges how much for which service or component. it is not commonly known that different cloud vendors have their pricing suitable for different workloads. understanding the application workload profile and corresponding cloud pricing can mean a saving of as much as 30% on annual cloud costs. we compared a few cloud vendors to draw price differences between their components. --> methodology cloud platforms compared we compared google cloud platform (gcp), amazon web services (aws), and microsoft azure for theirpricing. we used their respective pricing calculators. components compared we looked at compute (servers, linux), database, cloud storage, managed containerized solutions, load balancers, nat gateways, content delivery networks (cdn), serverless functions, secrets managers, logging and monitoring components, standard support costs and some artificial intelligence components. they were compared for similar workloads, as much as possible. in cases where an exact comparison was not possible (for example where say gcp offers a 2 vcpu compute engine with 3.75 gb ram, aws may offer 2 vcpu with a 4gb ram), we took the closest matching configurations limitations this study is only indicative and actual prices vary with your usage. these prices are also subject to change at the discretion of the cloud vendor cloud price comparison results compute instances compute instances are servers on the cloud that you can use for running your applications. you can choose the operating system, cpu, ram and persistent storage attached. compared capacity 2 vcpu, 8 gb ram, 100 gb storage, 100% monthly utilisation gcp usd 62 aws usd 40 azure usd 70 you can reduce your compute costs by opting for longer duration commitments. database comparison was carried on a dedicated, managed cloud mysql instance. managed databases are generally expensive components on all cloud vendors. compared capacity 1 vcpu, 4 gb ram, 30 gb storage, 100% monthly utilisation gcp usd 65 aws usd 79 azure usd 85 depending on your solution requirements, you may benefit by on-demand instances to save costs. cloud storage cloud storage is largely used for storing images, videos, documents, websites etc. this storage can be public (accessible on the internet) or private (accessible only from inside the cloud platform). storage is often associated with network transfer costs. compared capacity 30 gb storage, 100 gb network egress, 100% monthly utilisation gcp usd 9 aws usd 12 azure usd 5 some cloud vendors offer cold storage to store data not accessed frequently. they are cheap compared to regular cloud storage components. fully managed containerised solutions containers allow you to bundle your applications, dependencies and hardware resources so you can execute with restart-ability, efficiency and cost effectiveness. they virtualize any operating system so you can run your applications anywhere compared capacity kuberenetes, 200 concurrent requests, 3000 ms of execution time per request, 100,000 requests per month, 1 vcpu, 256 mb ram, cpu allocated during request processing gcp usd 41 aws usd 73 azure usd 89 opting for on-demand containers is often cost effective. serverless functions serverless functions allow you to run standalone functionalities without needing a server. they get executed on demand. they are often accompanied by some sort of api management solution needed to invoke them. know more compared capacity 10000 invocations, 10 mb network bandwidth per invocation, 256 mb ram, 1 vcpu, 3000 ms execution time gcp usd 0 aws usd 0 azure usd 0 with the right architecture, you can shift most of your functionality to a serverless function and save on your compute instance costs. load balancers load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool. while not needed in development or testing environments, they may be critical for production setups. know more compared capacity 5 forwarding rules, 30 gb ingress, 100 gb egress gcp usd 22 aws usd 17 azure usd 13 internet gateway an internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available vpc component that allows communication between your vpc and the internet. in some cases it can be highly recommended to have as an additional layer of security between your application and the internet. compared capacity 1 gateway, 100 gb egress gcp usd 6 aws usd 17 azure usd 13 content delivery networks (cdn) a cdn caches your content across various geographical locations so that users accessing your services from that location do not see significant delays in responses. this is highly recommended if say your website needs to be accessed from different continents. compared capacity cache 100 gb egress, 100,000 requests per month gcp usd 2 aws usd 2 azure usd 1 logging and monitoring while not always used, monitoring and logging components can help you trace back issues, track unintended accesses and serve as a general audit tool. compared capacity 10000 evenr=ts gcp usd 41 aws usd 15 azure usd 10 monitoring and logging components often work in conjunction with other cloud components which will also add to the cost. artificial intelligence - nlp just to keep the study indicative and concise, we only focussed on natural language processing apis across the given cloud vendors. compared capacity 4000 requests gcp usd 13 aws usd 30 azure usd 70 support costs support is not included by default. while email support may be available, any other support is chargeable and is often a percentage of your average monthly bill. compared capacity standard support, over a usd 100 monthly bill gcp usd 32 aws usd 10 azure usd 100 conclusion cost efficient for server based, serverless or stand alone applications with persistent storage. logging and monitoring is cheaper too. generally cheaper for cpu intensive applications. cost efficient for

Palantir was made to provide technological solutions to modern organizations using data and analytics. US government was their earliest customer. They wanted their help with problems like detecting patterns in child trafficking, drugs, cross border terrorism on social media platforms. And preventing financial fraud.\n</p>\n<p>\n    This story is about an attempt to prevent financial fraud through credit cards. It is said that the smart people at Palantir build sophisticated AI models that could look at a presented transaction and predict whether it had come from a fraudster using someone else's credit card or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n    A control room with a wall full of TV panels was set to show real-time credit card fraud rates across the concerned territories. They switch on the model, and wait with their breaths held…\n</p>\n<p>\n    And voila, the rates started to go down as they watched.
